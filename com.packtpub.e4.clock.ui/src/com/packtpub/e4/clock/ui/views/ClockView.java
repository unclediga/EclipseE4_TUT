/**
 * This sample class demonstrates how to plug-in a new workbench view. The view
 * shows data obtained from the model. The sample creates a dummy model on the
 * fly, but a real implementation would connect to the model available either in
 * this or another plug-in (e.g. the workspace). The view is connected to the
 * model using a content provider.
 * <p>
 * The view uses a label provider to define how model objects should be
 * presented in the view. Each view can present the same model objects using
 * different labels and icons, if needed. Alternatively, a single label provider
 * can be shared between views in order to ensure that objects of the same type
 * are presented in the same way everywhere.
 * <p>
